# C++ hello world targetted to repl.it online IDE

This project automatically sets up and configures repl.it IDE with
correct project information for autocomplete, code-navigation, and C++ standard information from a CMake Project.

How to use: 
 1. Create and clone a repl project by clicking
    ![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/JeremyBorys/repl-cpp11)
 2. Configure and build environment first by clicking "run"
 3. Refresh the IDE every configure and generate as cquery only reads
      compile_commands.json once on load (I could be wrong)
 4. Read-evaluate-print-loop it!

The default C++ Standard is C++17

The main binary is ./build/repl-example after build
